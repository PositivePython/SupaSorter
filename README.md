# SupaSorter

I am building Supa Sorter to fill a variety of needs.

1. I wanted to learn how to build sorting algorithms as a way of practicing my developing coding skills.
2. I was interested to understand how effective different sources are on differing environments.
3. I was keen to build an app that really does something so I can then refactor and improve iterably.
4. Ideally I will get a version of this so anyone can run it and upload data so I can explore the speed of different set ups.

Current Features

- Generates a random data set, length determined by the user.
- Runs 6 different sorts, using the Python sort method as the baseline, it really is incredibly fast!
- Shows how long each sort takes.
- Compares all the resulting sorted lists to make sure they match the baseline.

Future Features

- Program up to 10 different sorts.
- Add on option to either run the test you want or a rest cycle of different list lengths, save the data and output a graph using Pandas.
